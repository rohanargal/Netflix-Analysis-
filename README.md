# Netflix-Analysis

 Primary Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze the Netflix dataset using various tools such as Excel, SQL, and Tableau and gain insights into the content available on the platform. The analysis will help in understanding the preferences of the audience, the distribution of the content across countries, and the growth of the platform over the years.

Solution:    Firstly, we will use Excel to perform basic analysis such as calculating the mean, median, and mode of the ratings, and identifying the most popular genres and countries of origin.

Next, we will use SQL to query the dataset and extract more detailed insights. We will use SQL queries to identify the most popular titles, the distribution of the content across countries, and the growth of the platform over the years.

Finally, we will use Tableau to create data visualizations that help us better understand the data. We will create charts, graphs, and maps to represent the distribution of the content, the preferences of the audience

Result:    The project will help us to identify the most popular genres, countries of origin, and titles on the platform, leading to improved strategies for creating and promoting content. The project will also help in understanding the growth of the platform over the years and identifying trends that can inform decision-making for the future.
